jQuery plug-in for XBMC
=======================

Hi folks, this is my first attempt at a jQuery plug-in, so be kind. ;)

I'm working on a new web interface for my XBMC server and needed a comprehensive jQuery object to do my communications.
This is the result and I thought I'd share.

It requires one other jQuery plug-in, available at https://github.com/datagraph/jquery-jsonrpc.
